                    <li id="Dindigul briyani">Dindigul Thalappakatti Biryani:
                        <p>Origin: Dindigul, a city known for its vibrant culinary scene. The name "Thalappakatti" (meaning "turban-wearing") comes from the founder, Mr. Nagasamy Naidu, who always wore a turban.</p>
                        <p>Key Characteristics:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rice: Primarily uses short-grain, aromatic Seeraga      Samba rice (also known as Jeeraka Samba or Jeera Samba),    which absorbs flavors exceptionally well. This is a     hallmark of many Tamil Nadu biryanis.</li>
                            <li>
                                Profile: Known for its distinct tangy and slightly peppery     taste. The tanginess comes from the generous use of curd     (yogurt) and lemon juice in the marination.

                            <li>

                            <li>
                                Cooking Method: Often cooked slowly in large vessels,     allowing the spices and meat flavors to deeply infuse the     rice.
