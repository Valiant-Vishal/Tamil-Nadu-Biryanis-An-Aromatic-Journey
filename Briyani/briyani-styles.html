                            <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Dindigul, a city known for its vibrant culinary scene. The name "Thalappakatti" (meaning "turban-wearing") comes from the founder, Mr. Nagasamy Naidu, who always wore a turban.</p>

                                <li><strong>Flavor Profile:</strong> Known for its distinct tangy and slightly peppery taste. The tanginess comes from the generous use of curd (yogurt) and lemon juice in the marination.</li>
                                <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Features a unique, freshly ground masala that often includes ingredients like star anise, kalpasi (black stone flower), and cinnamon, giving it a dark, rich color and profound aroma.</li>
                                <li><strong>Meat:</strong> Most famous for its mutton biryani, where the meat is tender and well-integrated with the rice.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cooking Method:</strong> Often cooked slowly in large vessels, allowing the spices and meat flavors to deeply infuse the rice.</li>
